     Story="Empty Cave"
	   InspMessage="Once upon a time there was a cave. It was completely empty except for all the air. The air was everywhere as you would expect.
But you wouldn't expect to find a double-decker bus in a cave. And you would be right, because there were no double-decker buses in this cave.
There were however two potato peelers in the cave. One potato peeler was lying on the ground, and the other potato peeler was lying on the ground.
Five minutes later a boy called Boy walked into the cave. Guess what he was looking for?
Thats right, he was looking for his pet skunk called Stinky. Not much in here he thought, so he went away and never came back.
But then he changed his mind and did come back.
He saw one of the potato peelers and picked it up. He took a couple of potatoes from his pocket and started to peel them. Boy carried everything around in his pockets, just in case.
When he finished peeling the potatoes, he took a plate out of his pocket, sat down, squirted some ketchup on, and started to eat them. He was not able to cook them because he had left the cooker at home in the kitchen.
For pudding he fancied a chocolate ice-cream gateaux, so he looked around the cave to see if he could find any.
No luck, all he could find was another potato peeler. Just what he did not need.
Then a very mysterious thing happened. I can not tell you what it was, because its a secret.
Boy left the cave and went home.
When he got home he found that his mum had made him raw potatoes and ketchup for tea. That was a stroke of bad luck. His mum was not very bright, which is why she had called her son Boy. But for pudding he had chocolate ice-cream gateaux, which was a stroke of good luck.
He told his mum about the mysterious thing that happened in the cave. I can not repeat what he said because its a secret.
On Tuesday he went back to see if the cave was still there. And of course it was still there because caves can not move.
He sat down in the cave entrance and started to sing a song about a one-legged giraffe who could not stand up properly. Just when he got to the bit where the giraffe toppled over into a large vat of custard, the mysterious thing happened two more times.
Can you keep a secret? 
You promise not to tell anyone?
Well, what happened is this.
His pet skunk Stinky appeared like a ghostly vision. He was wearing a long robe and had a crown on his head. Amazingly, he could actually talk.
He was talking in a deep spooky voice and this is what he was saying,
Treasure! Treasure! Follow me to find the treasure!
So this time, Boy decided to follow him.
They went through a small tunnel at the back of the cave and eventually came out into another cave. This cave was larger than the first, and guess what it was filled with?
No, not treasure. Potato peelers. Hundreds and hundreds of potato peelers. It was a potato peeler factory, and they were being made by a team of about 20 skunks.
So this is where potato peelers are made, thought Boy. I have always wondered where the shops get them from.
But Stinky carried on to the back of the cave, and Boy followed him into another tunnel. This time they came out into an even bigger cave.
There was a sign at the entrance that said...Even Bigger Cave!.
But there was nothing in this cave except for a couple of toe nail clippings.
So they went through another tunnel and came to a sign that said...The Most Biggest Cave of All.
Boy could not believe his eyes when he looked around. The cave was brimming with treasure. It was truly bulging with treasure. Crammed full with treasure. Jam-packed. Choc-a-block. More treasure than the rest of the world put together.
This will make me rich beyond my wildest of dreams thought Boy.
Stinky said he could have all the treasure. The skunks did not want it because they were only interested in potato peelers.
So Boy stuffed all the treasure into his pockets. He had very deep pockets, but there was not enough room for a diamond-covered crown, so he wore it on his head.
On the way home he saw a huge giraffe leaning against a tree. The giraffe was sad, partly because he had lost three of his legs, and partly because his new shirt was covered in custard.
Please help me your Highness! said the giraffe. He thought that Boy was the king because of the crown on his head.
Boy felt sorry for the giraffe, and because he was the kindest boy in the world he gave him all the treasure.
The giraffe was delighted. Now he could afford to buy three wooden legs and a new shirt.
Boy took giraffe home and built him a tall shed in the garden. Mum thought up a good name for their new pet - Giraffe!
And they all lived happily ever after.
But remember, if you ever find two potato peelers in a cave and then go through the tunnel to the next cave, and then go through to the Even Bigger Cave and then go through to the Most Biggest Cave of All, you won�t find any treasure there because Giraffe has got it all."

	    Story="Todd's New Friend"
	   InspMessage=" Once upon a time there was a boy named Todd who had a perfectly good heart that ALMOST worked right.
The ALMOST part is what the problem was. The ALMOST part kept him from spending time outside with friends. It kept him from running and jumping and roller skating and sledding and swimming and playing basketball, and...well, you get the picture.
He was on a list at the hospital to get the ALMOST problem fixed, but that list didn't seem to be moving very fast.
The REASON he couldn't go outside (and the reason he was being homeschooled for now) was that if he caught a cold or the flu or the measles or something else from the other kids, and the hospital called saying it was time to fix the ALMOST problem, if he was sick he might miss his turn. So his parents said they just couldn't take that chance.	
As a result, Todd ended up spending most of his time in his own house. Mostly in his own bedroom. Where he could read books, and use the computer his Grandma gave the family a few years ago. And he could look out the window to watch the other kids play. But he was lonely.
Todd had one friend he could always count on. His Teddy Bear. Todd called him Tuffy. Tuffy was pretty good company, actually. He never argued. He never talked back.
He was simply there when you needed him.
And there's something to be said for a friend who's always there when you need him, right? 
So Todd and Tuffy would sit in the chair by the window, where Todd could lean on the windowsill, and watch the neighborhood kids at play.
Sometimes the other kids would wave and holler hello. Sometimes the other kids would holler something mean that would make Todd feel badly.
Today was a beautiful summer day, so Todd opened the window wide. He and Tuffy watched as the neighborhood children played in the water from the garden hose. The kids laughed and squealed as they tossed water balloons at each other. Todd's Mom always gave the neighborhood children permission to use their hose in warm weather.
'Hey'! shouted one of the kids. 'C'mon out and play!'
'I can't,' Todd said simply. 'I'm sick.'
When Autumn rolled around and the leaves turned color and started to fall from the trees, the neighborhood kids raked them into giant leaf mountains and then took turns jumping into the piles.
'Hey!' shouted a different neighborhood kid, whose name was Bud. He was taller than the others. 'You there in the window...what are you doing inside on a day like this...why don't you come outside and play with us?'
'I can't,' Todd replied sadly. 'I'm sick.'
Bud frowned. 'You don't look sick to ME,' he growled. 'I bet you think you're too good to play with us, don't you?'
Bud wore patches on his britches, and his hair grew in unruly thatches. He had a mean streak a mile wide, and he was always looking for a fight. Todd slowly shook his head. 'I'm sick,' he said. 'I'm not allowed to play outside.' And with that he closed the window and sighed.
When Winter arrived, Todd put Tuffy on chair next to him and opened the window just a crack. He wanted to hear the neighborhood kids playing, while not letting too much cold air into his room as he watched the activity. And there was a lot of activity to watch that day. It had snowed the night before, and there was at least a foot of fresh snow on the ground.
Randy and Candy, the twins from down the street, were in the vacant lot outside Todd's window, and so was their little brown dog Mandy, her tail busy wagging a mile a minute. Todd looked up. There came Sally, from across the street. 'Snowman!' she shouted. 'We're gonna' build a snowman!' The sound of their laughter carried all the way up to Todd's second floor window and it made him smile.
But soon Bud showed up, with his thatched hair sticking out every which way from underneath a bright blue stocking cap, and he too started helping to build the snowman. Just then Bud caught sight of Todd, sitting in the window. 'Hey Todd,' he shouted meanly, 'Too bad you're too SICK to come out and play! This is gonna be the best snowman we've ever made.'
Bud's words hit Todd just as hard as if he'd thrown a snowball right at his heart.
A single tear trickled down Todd's cheek as he closed the window and walked away.
He sat down on the side of the bed and hugged his bear. In a few minutes even more tears began to fall. 'I just want to be normal,' he sighed. 'I just want to have friends.'
Winter eventually ended, as it always does. The snow melted and brightly colored flowers began to bloom. Todd picked up Tuffy and together they went downstairs to the kitchen, which was right underneath his bedroom, and it too had a view of the big vacant lot next door, where the neighborhood children came to play. Todd shoved a kitchen chair next to the window and sat down, with Tuffy on his lap.
It was a nice day, so he opened the window and rested his elbows on the sill while he surveyed the view. A butterfly fluttered by. 'Did you see that Tuffy?' he grinned.	
And then he gasped. Because right after the butterfly, came the prettiest little girl he'd ever seen. She was skipping and singing softly to herself, every now and then stopping to pick a flower.
Her dark curly hair was worn long and she had on a dress that was the same color as the wild flowers that were growing in the field next door.
For some reason, she paused right underneath the kitchen window and looked up, right into Todd's eyes. And when she smiled the biggest, brightest, and most wonderful smile Todd had ever seen, he thought his heart had stopped for good.
He gasped again, and his mother quickly looked in and asked 'Todd...are you alright?'
'Yes, Ma'am,' he replied. 'I'm fine.'
And then he looked out the window again. The little girl was still there, but now Sally was with her. 'You'd best not talk to him,' Sally sneered, 'He's sick. He could drop dead just from you standin' there talkin' to him.' And then Sally turned and ran off to join her friends.
But the little girl stayed, and she cocked her head, looking up at Todd, as if she were taking his measurement.
'What's your bear's name?' she asked, as if they had never been interrupted.
'It's Tuffy,' he replied. 'And my name is Todd'.
The little girl smiled. 'They call me Pearl.' she said, her smile widening. And as she spoke, the same butterfly fluttered past again, and gently landed right in her hair, perching there like a beautiful jeweled hair ornament
'I have a bear,' she told Todd. 'His name is Happy. I named him that, because that's how he makes me feel.'
She looked closely at him again.
'Now, you tell me all about your sickness.' she demanded, and she sat right down on the grass outside the kitchen window.
So Todd told her.
And from across the field, the other children watched and wondered why that pretty little girl was spending all her time talking to the boy in the window. 
When Todd finished telling Pearl about his perfectly good heart that ALMOST worked right, and the list he was on at the hospital that didn't seem to be moving very fast, and the home-schooling, and the worry about the flu or the measles or whatever, which meant that he couldn't go outside to play, she looked right at him, as if this was just the simplest problem in the world to fix.  
'OK,' she said. 'Do you want to be best friends with me?' she invited, and Todd nodded his head enthusiastically.
'Fine,' she said. 'Then I'll just come to your house for a little while every day.'
'I even have a little chair I can bring with me.' she told him. 'I'll just sit right here outside your window, and we can visit, just the two of us, until you finally get fixed.'
'Then you can come outside and be friends with all of us.' she explained simply.
And that's exactly what happened.
The End."

	    Story="Lily and the Lion"
	   InspMessage="A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should bring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels; but the third, who was called Lily, said, 'Dear father, bring me a rose.'
Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle of winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of flowers, her father said he would try. So he kissed all three, and said goodbye.
And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow.
This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summertime and in the other half winter. On one side the finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked dreary and buried in the snow.
'A lucky hit!' said he, to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him one of the finest flowers.
This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce lion, and roared out, 'Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up alive!'
Then the man said, 'I knew not that the garden belonged to you; can nothing save my life?'
'No!' said the lion, 'Nothing, unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home. If you agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your daughter.'
But the man was unwilling to do so and said, 'It may be my youngest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when I go home.' Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, 'It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog.' And at last the man yielded with a heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever should meet him first on his return.
And as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest daughter, that met him. She came running, and kissed him, and welcomed him home. When she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was still more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep, saying, 'Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion.' Then he told her all that had happened, and said she should not go, no matter what would happen.
But she comforted him, and said, 'Dear father, the word you have given must be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him. Perhaps he will let me come safe home again.'
The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But to her amazement, the lion was really an enchanted prince.
By day he and all his court were lions, but in the evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The wedding feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his court; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself. Lily knew not where, till the night came again.
After some time he said to her, 'Tomorrow there will be a great feast in your father's house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you there.'
Then she rejoiced at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her. But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.
Her second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to go to the wedding, she said to the prince, “I will not go alone this time—you must go with me.” But he would not, and said that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care no light should fall upon him.
So at last they set out together, and took with them their little baby; and she chose a large hall with thick walls for him to sit in while the wedding torches were lighted; but, unluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door.
Then the wedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church, and passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light fell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her,  “Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me free.”
This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey.
Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven years. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet rest was still far off, for one day as she was traveling on she missed the white feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.
'Now,' thought she to herself, 'no aid of man can be of use to me.' So she went to the sun and said, 'Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill's top and the valley's depth hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?'
'No,' said the sun, 'I have not seen it; but I will give thee a casket—open it when thy hour of need comes.'
So she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, 'Thou shinest through the night, over field and grove, hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?'
'No,' said the moon, 'I cannot help thee but I will give thee an egg, break it when need comes.'
Then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night wind blew; and she raised up her voice to it, and said, 'Thou blowest through every tree and under every leaf, hast thou not seen my white dove?'
'No,' said the night wind, 'but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen it.'
Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had not seen it, but the south wind said, 'I have seen the white dove, he has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon; and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from you.'
Then the night wind said, 'I will give thee counsel. Go to the Red Sea; on the right shore stand many rods.
Count them, and when thou comest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and so the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you in their own forms.
Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to your home.
I will also give thee this nut,' continued the night wind. 'When you are half way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will immediately spring up a high nut tree on which the griffin will be able to rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole way; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let you both fall into the sea.'
So our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night wind had said; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the lion became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin's back, and went off carrying the prince away with her.
Thus the unhappy traveler was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said, 'As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.
She went on for a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle where the princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast being readied, and she heard that the wedding was about to be held.
'Heaven aid me now!' said she; and she took the cask that the sun had given her, and found that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself.  So she put it on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be sold.
'Not for gold and silver.' said she, 'but for flesh and blood.' The princess asked what she meant, and she said, 'Let me speak with the bridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.'
At last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the prince a sleeping potion, that he might not hear or see her.
When evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: 'I have followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the night wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?'
But the prince all the time slept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like the whistling of the wind among the fir trees.
Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow, and sat herself down and wept.
But as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then nestled under the old one's wings, so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood. 'Not for gold or silver, but for flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom in his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.'
Then the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to what she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked the chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the chamberlain told him all. How he had given him a sleeping potion, and how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was to come again that night.
Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping potion; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife's voice, and sprang up, and said,
'You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour.'
And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea. When they were halfway across Lily let the nut fall into the water, and immediately a large nut tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin rested for a while, and then carried them safely home.
There they found their little daughter, now quite grown up, and beautiful and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days."

	    Story="Jimmy and the Sea Monkeys"
	   InspMessage="Once, in a city not so far from where you live, in a time not so long ago, there was a little boy.
His name was Jimmy.
Jimmy lived in a nice home with his mom and dad. Jimmy liked spending time with his mom. Sometimes they would go to the park and play on the swings.
One thing that Jimmy loved to do was jump in puddles. He loved to make them splash.
Jimmy's mom would tell him not to do this. 'Don't jump in the puddles, Jimmy. You'll get all wet.'
Jimmy would shout back, 'No I don't, mom! Look at this!' and then Jimmy would jump in the puddle again, splashing the water. Only his shoes were wet.
So Jimmy would splash in the puddles even though him mom told him not to. And for a while, it was okay, and nothing terrible happened.
But one day Jimmy found a big, big puddle. 
Oh boy! He thought, this is going to be so much fun!
So he put his backpack down and started to back up. He was going to run and jump right into the puddle.
He started running straight for the puddle with a big grin on his face. He jumped and SPLASH!
He landed right in the puddle.
Something was wrong this time, though. Jimmy wasn't standing in the middle of the puddle, Jimmy was completely under water and he was sinking.
Down, down, down Jimmy sank. He didn't know how to swim. He began to get very scared.
Jimmy finally reached the bottom of the very big and deep puddle. He didn't know how to get back out again.
He sat down on the bottom and put his head in his hands. 'I should've listened to my momma!' He cried to himself. 'If I had only listened, this would never have happened and I would be home right now instead of stuck at the bottom of this deep puddle.
Jimmy looked up and saw something swimming towards him. He was even more scared. What if it was a shark?
Jimmy soon saw what it was. It was two sea monkeys.
The sea monkeys swam up to Jimmy and asked him why he was crying. Jimmy told them that it was because he didn't listen to his mom.
The sea monkeys didn't know what to do. They said, 'We will take you to our King. He is the oldest and the wisest of the sea monkeys and he will know what to do.'
And so the sea monkeys picked up Jimmy and swam with him towards their sea monkey kingdom. Jimmy saw a large castle.
The sea monkeys took him inside the castle and Jimmy could see the King. And the King saw Jimmy.
'I know. Jimmy broke down and started crying again and sobbed, 'My momma told me not to go jumping in the puddles and I didn't listen to her.'
'Don't cry, Jimmy,' said the King. 'You used to be my owner, you used to feed me and treat me well. The others are too new and won't remember you, but I remember you and I know that you are a good boy.'
'Can you get me back home again?' asked Jimmy.
'Yes,' the King smiled, 'yes, we will do that for you.'
The King spoke to the two sea monkeys that brought Jimmy to the castle, 'Take Jimmy back, back to the surface and the land where he belongs.'
The sea monkeys nodded and Jimmy said 'thank you' as they picked him up and carried him back.
Up, up, up they went. Closer and closer to the surface.
Finally they reached the spot where Jimmy had jumped from. Jimmy climbed out of the puddle and waved goodbye to the sea monkeys. The sea monkeys waved goodbye back.
Jimmy walked over and grabbed his backpack and then ran all the way home.
He didn't stop, not once, until he was back inside his house.
'Where have you been?' his mom asked, 'You're home late and you're soaking wet, what happened to you?
Jimmy ran and hugged his mom and gave her a kiss. 'I'm so sorry, mom!' Jimmy said. 'I'll never jump in another puddle again! I'll always listen to you from now on! I love you, mom!'
'Oh, Jimmy, I love you too. It sounds like you learned something good today.'
'I sure did,' Jimmy replied.
And Jimmy never jumped in another puddle again."

     Story="Lottie and the Confused Little Bear"
    InspMessage="Lottie was lonely. Lottie needed someone to hang out with. So she talked to her Dad and he said they could get a dog. He knew that a local kennel had some to spare so that's where they went, up the hill to Boondocks Farm.
Boondocks Farm was a lovely little place. It had once been a sheep farm and they still kept a few, along with other animals, as a small holding. They still breed their own sheep dogs and had started taking in borders and stays from around the way. This meant they old stables were always filled with many barking, howling and panting faces. Today was definitely no exception in fact the noise and excitement was tremendous. Dogs bounced, dogs barked everywhere was pandemonium. The only calm one was the old collie that sauntered out of the house, with a bouncy granddaughter in tow.
'Hello Lottie my dear girl' whispered the grand old lady 'What brings ee 'ere to visit us?'
'Hello Fran, I'm looking for a dog of my own, but first please do tell me what is happening?'
'Ah, now me dear that is a good question. Tis best I shows ee.'
With that Fran turned and wandered off toward the back of the sables. When they reached the corner of the stables they met two other collies, Toby and his big brother Barney.
'Roight Barney. Ee still at it?'
'Yeah Mum ee tis'
'Tis rite weird' said Toby.
'Well 'oy brought Lottie round to see 'im maybe she can work it out. She got brains this un.' Lottie blushed at the compliment from Fran who she knew was a very intelligent dog indeed.
All five of them carried on round the stables where Lottie saw the apparent cause of the trouble but she couldn't immediately say why. Lottie saw a dog, no taller than the collies but much bigger build with much thicker hair. Then, as she got closer she noticed the sound it was making. It was growling but not a simple dog growl like you might expect. It was more like a bad impression of a dog, it was saying 'Growl Growl' and instead of barking it was saying 'roar'.
Dear reader; have you ever pretended to be a bear or a lion? Do you remember the noises you made? Now imagine a dog doing the same. How bizarre.
Lottie moved closer to the dog. She was scared of the strange behaviour but was comforted by the feeling of Toby pressing against her. The brave collie was ready to protect her if needed. All of a sudden the creature rose up on his hind legs. But not like any dog. Some dogs will rise up in a strange prolonged jump, some performing dogs do a trick where they totter around on 2 legs. This was neither, its back was straight and its stumpy front legs splayed out to the sides. 'Roar' it said.
'That's just plain weird t’is' said Barney.
'Hello' said the brave little girl 'I'm Lottie, what's your name?'
The creature sank back down to all fours but its shoulders sank lower and the edges of its mouth sank too. 'I'm Max', it said sadly 'Aren't you scared of me?'
'No' said Lottie. Lottie didn’t have to lie, even though she had been scared seeing Max looking so small and sad changed it all around. 'Why would I be scared of a lovely fluffy thing like you?' Max perked up and his tail began to wag. Then he suddenly seemed to catch himself and dropped it down, almost like he was ashamed of it. 'You should be scared because I'm a bear!'
'You're a bear? Aren't Bears usually bigger?'
'I'm small for my size'.
Lottie couldn't help but giggle.
'I am a bear!' protested Max 'And that’s How I like it! I can prove it too.'
'Prove it? How?'
'I can do things that bears do. I can climb trees, I can fish and I can eat honey.' Lottie thought for a while and then had a great idea. 'OK Max if you can prove you’re a bear I will take you home and you can live with me'. Max smiled a great big toothy smile. 'That sounds great let's go find a tree'. So off Lottie and Max trotted toward the wood, with Barney and his little puppy Abi following on to watch the fun.
It took longer than expected to find a tree. Max seemed to have a million excuses why each one they found wasn't suitable. Lottie was happy to keep exploring but eventually Barney’s patients wore thin and he made Max agree to one. As trees for climbing go it should have been fine. It was a tall straight pine with its lowest branch just at the height of Lottie's head. Max made a great show of preparing to climb. Meanwhile Barney made a great show of cleaning himself. Max moved up to the tree and walked his front paws up as far as he could reach. Then, with a great roar of effort, he swung his hind legs around the trunk and….. slid slowly to the ground. This made Abi giggle. Max looked ashamed and started to stammer over his explanation. 'It.. It's my claws you see, worn down by living on concrete and walking on tarmac instead of in the woods where bears are meant to do their business. Everyone knows bears need claws to climb. I am a bear and what I am needs claws!'
'Never mind' said Lottie 'I'm sure your right about claws. Fishing next?' And so they all headed down to the river.
On the river bank they found a fisherman. They talked to him and he said he had had an excellent days fishing. 'That's great then Max let's find you a spot up stream and we can give this a try'. So they were soon in a quiet spot on the bank. Max waded out, somewhat clumsily, to a rock he had selected. Very soon Max was diving his paw into the water, just like the bears do in all the best documentaries, and pulled out… a hand full of weeds and a drink bottle. “That stupid human must have scared them all away. Everyone knows bears don't fish near humans' complained Max, 'I am a bear and I shouldn’t need excuses'.
'I'm sure your right again.' said Lottie while she patted Max on the back as he clambered out of the river. 'On to the last test.' So the four of them strolled together toward the village shop.
Lottie found she had enough money to buy one jar of honey which she took outside and placed it in front of Max. Max smiled and dug in hungrily. 'I know I couldn't climb..' He said between mouth fulls 'and I didn't do well at fishing', another lap into the jar 'But I can eat the honey'… 'so I am a bear right?'
'Lottie' whispered Barney 'Dogs eat honey too,' and gestured to Abi lapping at the lid of the honey jar. Lottie simply put her finger across her lips and shushed him. Turning to Max she said “I think you are brave enough and clever enough to be whatever you want to be ” ”So yes you are a bear and much more than that I would like you to be my bear'.
Max's eyes lit up and his tailed wagged. 'I’d like that very much Lottie' and so home they went, leaving Barney and Abi with the rest of the honey'"

     Story="Henna and Her Wiggly Tooth"
    InspMessage="Henna, the baby hippo wasn’t very happy. In fact, it had been two days since she had smiled at all! It all began a couple of days back when she was brushing her teeth as usual in the morning and she felt a strange feeling in her mouth. She continued brushing. Brush, brush, brush…There, she felt it again. She looked in the pond at her reflection and touched the spot where she had felt it. And goodness! Oh, goodness! Her teeth was wiggling. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle… it went.
She ran to her mom and in a trembling voice said, 'Mama, my tooth is falling out. I brush it every day and still, why?' Mama smiled at her and said, 'Oh, my little one has become a big girl now! It is only your milk tooth, Henna. Milk teeth will fall out one by one and new strong ones will come in their place, my dear'. Henna was horrified. What? Her teeth will fall out one by one!? What a sight she will look then. She didn’t want to lose her white pearly teeth. Oh, no!! And that is why she stopped smiling, lest her teeth fall out.
Mommy Hippo kept asking her again and again to wiggle it lose or the new one would come out crooked. But she refused to listen. Mommy hippo was only worried she might accidentally swallow it, but Henna didn’t let her come anywhere close. Tired of all the fuss Henna was making, she told Henna sternly that she would give her one more day to take the tooth out herself and after that she would have to take her to Dr Gerry Giraffe to pull it out.
Henna went to bed a very scared hippo. She had a very restless night, twisting and turning. Suddenly, in the middle of the night she sat up straight. She thought she heard a strange sound coming from her mouth. Boo… hoo… hoo…!!! It went. Hippo ran to look in the tiny piece of mirror she kept in her little treasure hole in the corner of the cave. She had quite a few collection of things there. One lost shoe, a piece of chalk and a key were just among some of the things she found near the river bank on days she managed to slip away unnoticed from her mother. Now she opened her mouth wide and what do you think she saw there?!! Her wiggly tooth was crying! Yes, it had eyes and a mouth and as soon as it saw Henna looking at it, it started wailing even louder. BOOO…..HOOO….HOOO….!!! Henna was so shocked she nearly forgot to breathe for a few seconds.
Then she gathered her wits and gently asked, 'Can you tell me why you are crying?' The tooth stopped crying and said, “Didn’t you know, that if you don’t pull out your teeth in time and put it under your pillow for the Tooth Fairy to find it, it will be lost forever?' 'Lost forever?' asked the confused Henna. 'Yes,' said the Tooth. 'When the Tooth Fairy finds the milk tooth, she takes it to a faraway land called Milky Land. All the milk teeth collected from children around the world are brought here where we have the Milky River. All the teeth jump into it, splash around and have fun till they are spotless and white again! A few days later they are taken back to the children and planted in the same spot in the mouth as a new tooth.'
Wow! I didn’t know that', said Henna, feeling very excited now. “So what is the problem then?' she asked. 'Well, you see when the child doesn’t pull out a tooth in time, the Tooth Fairy plants another tooth beside it. The new tooth grows and pushes the milk tooth giving the mouth a rather crooked smile and very soon the child is taken to a doctor to get the milk tooth removed. And when that happens the tooth is lost forever and it can never go to Milky Land!' said the tooth and began crying all over again louder and louder!! 'Alright, alright, I understand', said Happy. 'But are you sure?'. 'Of course I am sure. If you don’t believe me see for yourself. There is the new tooth right beside me.' Said the tooth indignantly. Henna looked inside her mouth closely and sure enough there was a new tooth right next to it. It was just a white little spot.
'Hmm…. Alright then. I will pull you out. But you better come out fast because I am scared.' The tooth nodded happily. Henna closed her eyes and nervously tugged at it. And out it came! It was so easy and it hardly hurt her at all. She felt very proud of herself for doing it all by herself. 'But what will happen to you?' she asked. 'Are you lost forever now?' 'No, no I can stay in Milky Land forever thanks to you,' said the Milk Tooth as Henna placed her gently under the pillow. And Henna went to sleep yawning, for she was very tired after this little night adventure.
Wasn’t it brave of Henna to help out the tooth even though she was scared? I am sure the Tooth Fairy will be leaving a nice amount of money for her under the pillow for being such a brave little girl. Did you pull out your first tooth on your own too?"

      Story="Santa’s Candy Canes"
    InspMessage="'Whoa-ho-ho!'
Crash!
It was Santa. He’d just fallen off the roof. He’d been busying himself putting up Christmas lights on the roof of his home, and slipped on the ice and fallen.
'Oh-ho-ho!' he wailed, sitting in a mound of snow, outside his twinkling house. A worried Rudolf looked at Santa.
'Rudolf, I think my leg is broken!'
With that Rudolf galloped off to find the elves.
When the elves got to Santa, they helped him up and then aided him in waddling painfully inside his house to get something to fix his leg.
Soon he was bundled up cosily by the fire, his leg bandaged.
'How am I going to deliver the presents with a broken leg?' he wailed to the elves.
Rudolf stood outside, looking into the window at Santa, misting up the glass with his warm breath each time he breathed.
The Head Elf gathered the other elves together and whispered his plan. The other elves giggled and without saying a word rushed off to the Pantry and came back with two big Candy Canes.
'You can use these as crutches.' explained the Head Elf to Santa.
Santa smiled.
'What would I do without you?' he said lovingly to his elves.
The next day was Christmas Eve, Santa mounted his sleigh and the elves packed his Candy Cane crutches along with the presents. Rudolf looked longingly at the Candy Canes. He loved candy. And red and white striped candy canes were his favourite.
'Now I have to be extra careful this year with this broken leg. I hope no-one notices me now that I’ll be moving so slowly. Ho-no-ho-ho!' laughed Santa.
The elves giggled.
Santa flew high into the air and the Reindeer dashed off to take him on his long night of deliveries.
Soon Santa reached Acres-Ville and got out of his sleigh and walloped the big sack of presents down onto the ground. He rubbed his back, balanced himself on his crutches and then waddled in the direction of the first house.
Rudolf looked longingly at the candy Canes. He couldn’t stop himself from licking them.
'Rudolf!' called Santa.
'Now you’ve made my crutches sticky, and my gloves along with it!' He protested.
Rudolf looked embarrassed but he still managed another lick. Soon the other reindeer joined him. Santa gave a little chuckle. Then quick as a flash disappeared down a nearby chimney and reappeared in the living room of the house the chimney belonged to.
He rummaged around in his sack and pulled out a present, his sticky glove getting stuck to the wrapping. He danced around the room trying to flap the present off his glove. The reindeer peered off the roof and into the windows to see what all the commotion was about. They looked on and giggled as quietly as they could.
Santa was flapping around the room and managed to knock a lamp off a nearby table. The reindeer stopped laughing as a light went on in the house.
Santa, dropped the sticky, half unwrapped, torn gift and shuffled back up the chimney as fast as he could. Whew! That was a close one.
This same routine went on from house to house, as Santa’s sticky gloves stuck to each and every present he pulled from his sack. Santa was disappointed. He trudged back to the sleigh, with a string of tinsel he’d managed to pull off a Christmas tree with his sticky Canes, trailing behind him. He’d left each house a sticky tangled mess.
'So much for not being noticed, hey Rudolf?' he said to Rudolf, trying to make himself feel better about his disasterous deliveries, as they flew to make their last stop. Santa looked inside his sack, only one more delivery to make, Farmer Pepper Seed’s house.
Now Farmer Pepper Seed lived on a farm and his house was right in the middle of all his fields. Santa took a deep breath.
'Let’s see if we can do this one without being noticed.' He smiled as he winked at Rudolf.
The reindeer glided above the houses and took Santa safely onto Farmer Pepper Seed’s roof.
'So far so good.' smiled Santa as he got out of the sleigh.
Rudolf stuck out his tongue and licked Santa’s Canes one last time.
Instead of being angry Santa laughed.
'Well I suppose everyone knows I come round each year, so one more lick won’t hurt.' He smiled, thinking of the sticky trail of evidence he’d left of his visit.
He started waddling towards the chimney, but Farmer Pepper Seed’s roof was a little uneven and before he knew where he was, he had rolled off the roof and was again sitting in a mound of snow looking up at his reindeer.
The cotton candy sheep that had been grazing near the house inched closer to have a better look at Santa.
'Oh-ho-no!' cried Santa, as he held out his sticky gloved hands to stop them.
But the silly sheep didn’t listen they just came closer anyway. Santa tried to get away from them, but they surrounded him and they managed to get stuck to his sticky Candy Canes, he tried to pull them off, but they then stuck to his gloves. He danced all the way around the fields, trying to shake the silly sheep loose but they stuck fast.
Eventually Santa gave up. He waddled into Farmer Pepper Seed’s house, through the door! He got sticky glove prints all over the door handle. With all the sheep stuck to his canes, he knocked over the Christmas Tree and left tufts of cotton candy everywhere! Farmer Pepper Seed’s house really looked a sight! Santa, clad with sticky sheep waddled out into the snow and crunched his way heavily toward his sleigh. The reindeers looked like they would burst out laughing, Santa looked so funny, but they tried their best to look serious.
'Not one word.' said Santa, as he climbed into his sleigh.
'baaaaa!' said one of the sheep as Santa sat down and squashed it’s tail.
The reindeers laughed. The sheep laughed and then finally Santa laughed. They laughed so much that all the Loopies in Acres-Ville heard them and came out of their houses. Even the sleepy moon turned round to have a look at what was so funny.
'Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas everybody!' laughed Santa as he motioned the reindeer to begin flying. The jingling bells of his sleigh tinkled as his sleigh rose higher and eventually Acers-Ville was out of sight.
'Quite an exit, eh Rudolf?' smiled Santa, as he began to think being noticed wasn’t such a bad thing after all. And he flew home across the sky, thinking about how he should go about being noticed next year."

   Story="Ruff Meets the Queen"
    InspMessage="Ruff’s bathroom was an absolute mess! Soap, face cloths and toothpaste littered the sink and the floor. The bath was full of cold dirty water and there were toothpaste splatters all over the mirror. But there in the middle of it all stood a polished and clean, not-a-hair-out-of-place Ruff.
You see today was a very important day as today was the day Ruff would meet the Queen.
'Ruff the Limousine is here!' called Rufus, his brother, from downstairs. Ruff did feel a little out of place, as he always did things with his brother, and today he would be on his own. Ruff was clumsy at the best of times and had promised himself and his brother he would be swave and dashing today.
There was great excitement in the air as Rufus and Ruff had opened the gold guilded envelope bearing Ruff’s name. He had been invited by the Queen personally to join her for lunch at the palace. Ruff was ready for the challenge. He stumbled nervously down the stairs.
'Well don’t you look smashing then?' smiled Rufus.
Ruff smiled brightly.
'You’ve got to do better than that!' encouraged Rufus.
Ruff stood on tippy-toes and grinned his toothiest grin. A beam of sunlight streaming in from the window reflected off of Ruff’s freshly brushed teeth, bathing him in a glow of white light, which made him look like royalty.
'There that’s better! Now have a good time Scamp!' smiled Rufus as he slapped his brother on the back, sending him toward the waiting limousine.
At the palace everything looked larger than life! So dramatic and built on a grand scale.
A Loopie in an orange and green striped tie came out to meet Ruff.
'My name is Tim, I’ll be your palace guide and take you to see the Queen.' He explained.
Ruff grinned and walked with Tim into the emence Entrance Hall. Ruff starred, so much artwork and shiny golden statues decorated the room. Ruff decided to act as casually as possible and stroll around the room admiring the beautiful decorations.
He stopped at a nearby statue and looked at his reflection in it. He carefully polished his teeth with his tongue and grinned at himself to check that his teeth were still clean. They where, and as pearly white as ever!
'Would you please welcome her royal highness. The Queen!' boomed a palace guard, standing at the top of the stairs leading down to where Ruff stood.
Ruff startled a little by the booming announcement stepped back and bumped straight into a suit of shiny armour. Clatter! Ruff jumped and checked to see if he hadn’t dislodged anything. Tim smiled, he had stopped it from falling. Phew!
Ruff looked up at the Queen who was making her way down the stairs and toward him. He was a bit nervous and all he could do at that moment was grin. He then thought back to what Rufus had said earlier, 'You can do better than that!' he heard his brother say. Ruff grinned harder.
And as he did a ray of sunlight coming in from one of the high windows shone directly onto Ruff’s teeth and reflected off of them, but with such intensity, the Queen was momentarily blinded and tripped! She rolled straight down the stairs and landed in a heap at Ruff’s feet. Tim rushed to her aid, while all Ruff could do was stare at the clumsy Queen. The palace guards rushed in too to help the Queen to her feet, but looking headlong into the glare coming from Ruff’s shiny teeth, they too tripped and fell to the floor in a heap.
'Um,' stammered the Queen, which was very unlike her as Queen’s don’t stammer!
'I thought we could eat lunch out in the garden today.' she said as Tim helped her to her feet.
The Queen straightened her hair and led Ruff out into the garden. The garden was just as grand as the palace! Huge green lawns rolled on for as far as Ruff could see. The lunch table was decked with every tasty treat imaginable!  There were, cupcakes, pancakes, sausage rolls, jam pastries, salads, drumsticks and even battered prawns! Ruff’s mouth watered.
'After you.' smiled the Queen as she motioned for Ruff to sit down. Ruff sat awaiting his culinary adventure. The Queen smiled at Ruff as she took her seat, Ruff grinned back, again summoning another shaft of light from the heavens, which again blinded the Queen.
'Oh noooo!' she shrieked. She tried desparately to find her napkin to hold it up and stop the glare, but she knocked over her soup and pulled the battered prawns onto her lap! The little tiered display holding the meatballs was the next thing to come cascading down! The Queen was still shrieking while being pelted with tumbling meatballs. Ruff was so shocked and surprised he didn’t know what to do, so he just continued grinning!
One of the nearby waiters rushed to the Queen’s aid. But as soon as he got close to Ruff, he too became blinded by the glare from Ruff’s shiny teeth. He slipped on a meatball and came crashing into the rest of the lunch. The punch bowl wobbled and tilted, baptizing the Queen and the waiter in purple liquid. The Queen spluttered and wiped a jam pastry from her eye.
'I do apologise.' said the Queen, trying to avoid looking directly at Ruff, who was still grinning.
After lunch, Tim led Ruff out to the limosine which took him back home to an eagerly awaiting Rufus.
'So?' asked Rufus.
'How was lunch?'
'You’ll never believe it Rufus!' replied Ruff.
'But the Queen is just as clumsy as me.' He declared triumphantly.
Rufus shook his head in disbelief. A clumsy Queen? Now who could have ever imagined that?"

	    Story="God's Green Thumb"
	   InspMessage="Back in the day...
...when God first made the Earth, God looked down and he saw that there was no one to take care of it.
So God reached down into the ground and scooped up some stuff from the earth. He took the stuff from the earth into his hands and formed it into a man. But the man just laid there on the ground like a lump of clay. There was no life in him. So God bent down again and breathed into the man - and the man became alive!
The man's body was made from the earth, but his life came from the breath of God. Always remember that. Your life is the breath of God.
God called the man, 'Adam.'
Then God planted a garden in Eden for Adam to live in. And since God is God, he is a pretty good gardener. He planted all kinds of trees in his garden; apple trees, and pear trees, banana trees and mango trees, fig trees and who knows what other kinds of trees in his garden. God wanted to make sure there was plenty of good things to eat. (Don't ask me why he didn't plant any candy trees!).
In the middle of the garden God also planted two special trees. One was called the Tree of Life, and the other was called the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
And God made a stream of clear, cool water to flow through the middle of the garden to water it and keep it green.
Then God brought Adam to the garden and he told him, 'Take care of my garden. You may eat the fruit of any of the trees that I have made to grow there. But be careful. Do not eat any of the fruit from the tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. If you eat any of that fruit, you will die.'
So Adam began to live and work in the garden God had made for him.
The garden was a wonderful, beautiful place.
But Adam was lonely and sad.
Even though the garden God had made for him was the most beautiful place there could ever be, Adam was lonely.
Adam needed some company. So God reached into the ground again and took some more stuff from the earth. This time he made every kind of animal and every kind of bird. He brought them all to Adam to see what he would call them.
It must have taken a long, long time to think up all those names! 
Luckily, he didn't call them things like 'Foo Foo' or 'Snuggems' or 'Pooky' or anything like that. Instead. he called them 'gerbils' and 'rabbits' and 'rhinoceroses.' And he called the birds 'eagles' and 'egrets' and 'ruby throated warblers.'
Well, actually, we don't know WHAT Adam named them. He didn't speak English. But he named each kind, and that's important because people are the only ones that name things. Your dog knows what a squirrel is, but he doesn't call it a squirrel. He just barks at it! But naming things is one of the things that shows we are different from all the other creatures that God made.
But even with all the animals around to keep him company, God saw that Adam was still sad. Monkeys are fun to play with, but they don't have very much to say... and they have terrible table manners.
So God made Adam fall asleep (he must have conked him on the head or something. Not really!), and while Adam was sleeping, God took one of his ribs.
God took Adam's rib and he made a woman from it. When Adam woke up, God brought Eve to him (that's what Adam named her later on), and Adam said,
'At last! Here is someone like me! Her bones were made from my bones, and her body was made from my body. I will call her 'woman' because that means she was taken out of man.'
At last Adam was happy. 
And so Adam and Eve lived together in God's garden. And do you know what? They were naked and nobody cared... or thought it was funny!
...the old people from long ago told their children about how bad things came into the perfect world God had made.
Things were going along quite nicely in the perfect place that God had made for Adam and Eve. But then one perfect, warm sunny day, Eve was walking through the garden. And there, in the middle of the garden, she met the serpent.
You need to know that the serpent was the one we call the devil, or sometimes we call him Satan. Satan is an angel who decided he didn't want to do what God said anymore, so God sent him out of heaven. And from that day on, Satan became God's enemy. 
Now, the thing is, Satan is a liar. He has always been a liar. And he is tricky too. And because he is God's enemy, he hates everything God loves, and does everything he can to ruin it.
So the serpent said to Eve,
'Did God really tell you that you couldn't eat the fruit from any tree in the garden?'
That's not what God said at all, and Eve knew it. So she said to the serpent,
God said we may eat the fruit from any tree in the garden - except the fruit from the tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. If we even touch that fruit, we will die.' Well, that wasn't quite true either, was it. God never said anything about touching the fruit.
The serpent answered, 'That's not true at all! You will not die! God only said that because he knows if you eat that fruit you will become like him. You will become wise. You will know the difference between right and wrong.'
And this is where Eve made her big mistake.
Instead of leaving right then, she stayed a while. She saw that the fruit on the tree looked very good. And she started thinking how nice it would be to be like God and know everything. But she also knew that God had said not to eat the fruit from that tree. Except now she was starting to think maybe it would be okay anyway. That fruit did look good. And the more she looked at it, the more she wanted it - and the more she forgot what God had said.
That is how temptation works. It is when you know something is wrong, but you want to do it anyway. And pretty soon the wrong thing you want to do starts to look good. And you think maybe just this one time it will be okay to go ahead and do it. You think the bad things that always come when you do what is wrong won't happen this time.
But they always do.
That's why things are wrong, because when you do them someone always gets hurt, sooner or later. But Eve wasn't thinking about that. She was only thinking about how delicious the forbidden fruit looked.
So Eve took some of the fruit, and she ate it.
And she gave some to Adam, and he ate it.
And all of a sudden they knew that they were naked.
Before that they were like little kids who run around naked and nobody cares - because little kids don't know any better. That's how Adam and Eve were before they ate the fruit God told them not to. Before that, they didn't know any better. They didn't know the difference between right and wrong. Now they did. Now they knew they were naked. And they were embarrassed.
Later that day...
God was walking through the garden in the cool of the evening as he liked to do. But when Adam and Eve heard him coming they hid from him in the bushes. They were embarrassed and afraid. God called to them, 'Adam! Eve! Where are you?' (Of course, God knew where they were).
Adam answered from behind the bushes, 'Right here, Lord... I heard you coming... so I hid from you... because I am naked.'
'Who told you that you were naked?' God asked. 'Did you eat the fruit I told not to eat?' God knew that he had. He always knows.
'It wasn't me!' Adam said, 'the woman you gave me, she made me do it!'
So God said to Eve, 'Is that true?'
And Eve said, 'It wasn't me! The serpent made me do it!'
They were in big trouble now."

	    Story="The Story of Prophet Jonah"
	   InspMessage="I don't want to...
Would you ever say that to God?
Jonah did.
God said to Jonah, 'Go to Ninevah!'
And Jonah said, 'I don’t want to!'
Well, he didn’t exactly SAY that to God - but that's what he was thinking.
Back in Jonah’s day - this was a LONG time ago, about 800 years before Jesus was born - the greatest city in the world was Ninevah. Everyone had heard of Ninevah. And everyone knew it was an evil place.
So, God had a job for Jonah.
'Jonah,' God called, 'Get up! Go to Ninevah!'
'Tell the people there that I know all about the terrible things they are doing. They think no one can see the evil things they do. But I see!'
But Ninevah was a big, scary place, and Jonah didn’t want to go!
Besides, the Assyrians lived in Ninevah, and the Assyrians were big bullies. They were always beating up on everybody, especially Jonah's people. They deserved to get in trouble from God.
If Jonah warned the people of Ninevah, they might change their evil ways - and then God might forgive them (God is always forgiving people!) - and then they might get away with all the terrible things they have done. 
That wouldn't be fair!
So, do you know what Jonah did?
He ran away.
(Illustration: Jonah, exit, running all the way!)(Illustration: Jonah, exit, running all the way!)
Jonah went down to Joppa and jumped on a ship that was sailing for Tarshish. Tarshish was a city in Spain, or maybe it was what we call the whole country of Spain now, I am not entirely sure, but whatever, it was about as far away as a person could go. Jonah thought, 'God will never find me there.'
But God knows where every gnat, ant, and bug on the face of the earth is. He knows when a mosquito lands on your nose. He knows where it came from, and where it goes. Of course God would know where Jonah went!
So the ship put out to sea, with Jonah hiding from God below the deck.
But God wasn’t going to let Jonah get off that easy. 
Just as the last bit of land disappeared from view, God sent a terrible storm. 
Sometimes God has to send storms of one kind or another to bring us back to him. But no matter how terrible the trouble, God’s power is always greater. God is always with us - sometimes in amazing ways.
Jonah was about to learn that.
(storms)
It was the worst storm the sailors on Jonah's ship had ever seen. The sky turned black. The winds roared. Rain stung the sailors' faces. Wave after wave lifted their ship high into the air and sent it crashing down again. 
The sailors were terrified!
They were sure their ship would break in two, and so they started grabbing all the stuff they didn't need and throwing it over the sides to keep from sinking.
Meanwhile, the one thing they really needed to throw over the side was asleep below the deck. It was Jonah.
The captain crawled down under the deck and shook Jonah, 'Wake up, man! We are all going to drown! Pray to your God to save us!'
Above the deck, the sailors were fighting the storm with all their might. 'Why are the gods so angry with us?' they shouted to each other.
(They were smart enough to know that there was a god who made the earth and the sea and everything in it - but in their time of trouble, they didn’t know who he was. A lot of people are like that.)
'Let’s draw straws,' one of them shouted through the storm, 'Maybe this god - whoever he is - will show us who is causing all our trouble.' And so they all scrambled below the deck and got some straws ready.
Jonah drew the shortest straw.
'This is all my fault!' Jonah said.
'My name is Jonah, and I am a Hebrew. I worship the Lord God, the God of Abraham, the creator of the earth and the sea and all that there is.'
'What have you done to make your God so angry?' the sailors asked.
'Um... well.... (Jonah didn’t want to have to admit it)... I am running away from God.' Jonah said, and he told then the whole story - well, as best he could, shouting over the raging storm.
'What can we do to save ourselves?' the sailors cried.
'Throw me into the sea and you will be saved,' Jonah said.
Jonah knew it was the only thing they could do. He would have to take his punishment. One person would have to die so that the others could live. Many, many years later Jesus was going to do the very same thing. Only, he took OUR punishment. He died for us, so that we could live with him forever.
But the sailors weren’t willing to throw Jonah into the churning sea. They thought if they tried real hard, they could save themselves without God's help. And so they rowed with all their might to try to get the ship back to dry land.
But it was no good. The winds just blew all the harder, the rain stung their faces all the more.
Finally, they cried out, 'Please, O God of this man Jonah, forgive us for what we are about to do!' 
And then the sailors picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea.
At once the winds stopped, the waves rolled away, and the sea became as smooth as glass. Now those sailors knew who the real God is, the God who can calm the seas.
They thanked God for saving their lives, and they vowed to follow him from that day on.
Jonah saved their lives twice that day! He saved them from the storm (well, GOD saved them - Jonah helped), and he saved them from something much worse than that - a life without knowing God.
(graphic - Jonah under the sea)
Meanwhile, Jonah was sinking down into the cold, black waters.
But Jonah couldn’t get away from God THAT easy! Even down in the deep, dark sea, God was with him.
And so God sent Jonah a fish - not a fish sandwich for lunch, but a big fish - and Jonah was the lunch.
The fish swallowed Jonah with one big gulp.
Instead of Jonah catching the fish, the fish caught Jonah. God seems to have a different idea of fishing than we do!
For three days Jonah sat in the dark, wet, smelly belly of that fish. But he was alive! And so Jonah prayed;
'When I was in trouble,
I called to My Lord
and he heard my prayer.
Even from the belly of a fish,
in the deep, dark sea,
God could hear my voice!
The water swallowed me up,
sea weeds wrapped around my legs.
And then I remembered my God.
I called out to him,
and in his holy temple
he heard the sound of my cry!
My God saved me!
And so I will give him
an offering of thanks.
I have made my vow,
and I will pay it!
For our God saves!'
Then God whispered to the fish, and the fish spit Jonah out onto dry land. 
That fish was probably glad to get rid of bony old Jonah, making all that noise in his belly.
Jonah spent three days in the belly of a fish, and stepped out alive again - just like Jesus would spend three days in the belly of the earth, and step out alive. How great and powerful God is!
Then God said to Jonah, 'Okay, Jonah, get thee up! Now go to Ninevah!'
This time Jonah went the right way.
(hot sun)
Ninevah was a big city. It took three whole days to walk all the way from one side to the other. It had walls all around a hundred feet tall, and so wide three chariots could ride, side by side.
THAT is a big city! 
Jonah walked into the center of the city and he shouted out, 'In 40 days God is going to destroy this city you think is so great!'
Now, that’s not the kind of thing most people want to hear. And Jonah must have thought that no one would pay much attention to him.
But Jonah was in for a surprise.
The people of Ninevah listened to Jonah. The evil there must have been so bad, that everyone knew they couldn’t go on like that. They needed someone to show them the way out. And Jonah showed it to them. They could turn to their loving God.
And so, from the greatest to the least, they got rid of all their evil things (just like the sailors threw overboard the things that were making them sink when they were in trouble) - and they begged God for his forgiveness.
When the king heard the news of this, he didn’t get angry as you might have expected.
Instead, he tore off his royal robe, and put on an old robe made of the cheap, scratchy stuff they made sacks out of. He took off the robe of a king, and put on the robe of a beggar, to show he understood that God is the real king, and compared to God, he was nothing but a poor beggar.
And then the King made a decree. There would be a fast. No one was to eat or drink, not even the animals of their herds. Everyone was to put on sackcloth, and cover themselves with ashes, to show how dirty they must be in the sight of God.
'Let us call out to God!' The King decreed. 'Let us all stop the evil things we have been doing. Let us stop hurting each other, and maybe God will have mercy on us. Maybe he will forgive us, and not destroy our city like we deserve.'
When God saw that they really were turning from the evil way they were living - and that they weren’t just saying it - he had mercy on them. 
God decided he would not destroy the city after all.
God saved their lives!
Jonah Pouts
(hot, hot sun)
When God first called Jonah, Jonah did the exact opposite of what God asked him to do. But God didn't give up on him. God used him to accomplish his plan. It was just a little more painful than it had to be!
But now, Jonah was mad.
These people did mean, rotten and nasty things. They were famous for it! They didn’t follow God, and still they had everything they wanted. It wasn’t fair!
'How come they should get off so easy!' Jonah grumbled to himself. Secretly he had been looking forward to watching God really punish them good.
Now God was giving them a second chance. 
'I knew this would happen,' Jonah said to God. 'I knew you would let them off the hook!'
I guess Jonah forgot just WHO got let off the hook in the first place.
'I knew it!' Jonah said to God. 'I knew that you are full of everlasting love, and that you are always ready to forgive and to hold back from punishing.'
So Jonah walked to the edge of the city and sat down to pout. Maybe the city would go up in a ball of fire anyway. That is what he was hoping to see.
Now, the sun was burning down on Jonah. Sweat was rolling down his face and stinging his eyes.
So God made a bush grow up next to where Jonah was pouting, to shade him from the sun.
Jonah was thankful for the bush and the comfort of the shade.
But the next morning, God sent a worm to eat the roots of the bush. The bush withered and died. When the sun came up, God sent a scorching eastern wind, heated by the desert. The sun beat down on Jonah’s head until Jonah nearly fainted. 
Jonah cried out to God (well, whined, more likely!) 'Why don’t you just take my life now, and save me from this misery!'
Poor Jonah. He was having such a rough time!
'Jonah, Jonah, Jonah!' God said to him. 'Do you think I have stopped loving and caring for you? I could never do that!
'You are so upset because I let a little bush die - but you want me to destroy the whole city of Ninevah! Aren’t all these people worth far, far more than a little weed?
'Didn’t I forgive you, even though you tried to run away from me? I love you so much!
'Even though these people didn’t know me, and they sinned against me, I love them as much as I love you.'
And then at last, Jonah understood that God truly is slow to anger, and always willing to forgive us when we turn to him.
Now he knew that our wonderful God truly is tenderhearted and forgiving, and overflowing with a love for us that will never end."

	   InspMessage="Jesus did amazing things...
While the disciples - and more than five thousand other people! - were all sitting out in the sun on a rocky hillside, Jesus took two smelly fish and five crusty loaves of bread and fed them all! 
'WOW!' The disciples must have thought, 'We should open a restaurant!'
Well, maybe they didn’t think that exactly! But they were amazed by the miracle they just saw Jesus do.
The crowd was still buzzing about the whole thing when Jesus took Peter by the arm and said, 'You guys go on ahead to the other side of the lake. I’ll catch up with you later.'
Okay, we don’t really know what Jesus said exactly. For one thing, he was speaking in Aramaic and not English. And chances are pretty good he didn’t call the disciples ‘you guys.’ But we do know that Jesus told the disciples to get in their boat and go across the lake. He needed some time to be alone.
Well, imagine if you had crowds of people following you around everywhere you went, always wanting something from you. You’d want to get away to be alone sometimes too! But what Jesus really needed was time to pray. We all do!
So Jesus blessed the people and sent them on their way home. And he sent them away full - not just with a good meal, but with the word of God. They all left knowing a little better just how much God loved them. So Jesus watched the last few stragglers pick their way through the rocks, and then he turned and climbed up the mountain a ways.
When night came, Jesus was still there praying, alone on the mountainside. Of course, he wasn’t really alone. He was with his Father. No one is ever really alone. God is always with us.
(illustration - dark mountains)
Meanwhile...
...the disciples were on the lake below, trying to row across it.
It was very dark now, and a strong wind was blowing right in their faces. Well, right in the faces of the lucky ones who weren’t trying to row against it. Those poor guys had their backs to the wind and were rowing against it with all their might - and hardly getting anywhere!
'This is just great!' they were probably grumbling to each other as sprays of water splashed in their faces and the waves tossed their little boat every which way - except the way they wanted to go! 'Jesus sends us out across the lake with this blasted wind doing its best to blow us back! Couldn’t he do something about that?!' (We like to grumble whenever things get hard, don’t we.)
But Jesus could see that they were in trouble.
The wind was howling, the sea was still tossing their boat this way and that, when one of the disciples happened to look out into the night.
'WHAT IS THAT?!!!'
There was a man walking on the water!!! 
In the dark of the night they saw a man coming towards them on the water - his hair was blowing wildly, his robe was being whipped by the wind like a flag in a windstorm.
They were terrified!
...well, wouldn’t YOU be?!
'IT’S A GHOST!!' they screamed.
But just then, they heard a voice say, 'Take courage! Don’t be afraid. It is me!'
It was Jesus!
'Lord, is it really you?' Peter said, holding his hand over his eyes to block the spray of the splashing waves.
'If it really IS you, tell me to come out to you on the water!'
Peter was a brave man! Or he was crazy!
Jesus said, 'Come.'
Peter stuck one leg out over the side of the boat and set his foot on the water. It didn’t sink in!
He stepped out with his other foot, and it didn’t sink. He stood up. He was standing on the water! He took one step, and then another, and then another. He was walking on the water, just like Jesus!
Peter was walking on the water!
He might have even been thinking to himself, 'Hey! Look at me. I am walking on the water! Aren’t I great!'
But wait a minute. People can’t walk on water. And then Peter started to look around him. All of a sudden, the boat seemed awfully small and far away. There was nothing but black, churning water all around him. The waves were lapping at his feet, water was stinging his eyes.
And then, just like that, the water under his feet let go.
'Help me, Lord!' Peter gulpped, splashing wildly as the cold water swallowed him down. 'Save me!'
But before the water could gulp Peter down entirely, Jesus reached down with his strong hand (he WAS a carpenter after all) and grabbed him by the arm.
'Oh you of little faith, why did you doubt?'
And with that, Jesus pulled Peter up out of the water and carried him, dripping wet, back to the boat.
Just as they were climbing over the side of the boat, the wind died away and the sea turned smooth as glass. Everything was suddenly peaceful and quiet.
One minute the wind was roaring and the sea was crashing, the next all was peaceful and calm. Some of the disciples must have remembered just then the Psalm they learned in Hebrew school -
'Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress. He stilled the storm to a whisper, the waves of the sea were hushed.'
(That was from Psalm 107, in case you haven’t been to Hebrew school yet.)
Those disciples knew that only God has the power to calm the wind and the waves - and that’s just what Jesus did.
'Truly you ARE the Son of God!' they said to Jesus in awe and wonder. And they bowed down and worshipped him right then and there.
Now...
...we don’t know for sure, but maybe Peter sat there shivering in the back of the boat with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders, thinking about all that had just happened. And maybe he was hearing over and over in his head the words Jesus had calmy said, ‘Why did you doubt?’
‘Oh, you of little faith. Why did you doubt?’
Why DID Peter doubt?
Just the day before he saw Jesus turn two fish and five loaves of bread into enough to feed five thousand people. And now he saw Jesus walking on the water. Jesus said it was okay, so he stepped out onto the water. He trusted Jesus.
He stepped out of the boat because Jesus had called him, and his faith held him up.
But then he saw the darkness all around him, he felt the the wind stinging his face, he saw the swirling black water beneath him... and he doubted. He took his eyes off Jesus and he became afraid.
He forgot about Jesus.
And he sank.
And it may be that Peter learned a lesson that night that he never forgot. When trouble is all around - keep your eyes on Jesus. He will never let you sink."

	    Story="The Prince and The Princess"
	   InspMessage="There was once a prince, and he wanted a princess, but then she must be a real Princess. He travelled right around the world to find one, but there was always something wrong. There were plenty of princesses, but whether they were real princesses he had great difficulty in discovering; there was always something which was not quite right about them. So at last he had come home again, and he was very sad because he wanted a real princess so badly.
One evening there was a terrible storm; it thundered and lightninged and the rain poured down in torrents; indeed it was a fearful night.
In the middle of the storm somebody knocked at the town gate, and the old King himself sent to open it.
It was a princess who stood outside, but she was in a terrible state from the rain and the storm. The water streamed out of her hair and her clothes; it ran in at the top of her shoes and out at the heel, but she said that she was a real princess.
‘Well we shall soon see if that is true,’ thought the old Queen, but she said nothing. She went into the bedroom, took all the bed clothes off and laid a pea on the bedstead: then she took twenty mattresses and piled them on top of the pea, and then twenty feather beds on top of the mattresses. This was where the princess was to sleep that night. In the morning they asked her how she slept.
‘Oh terribly bad!’ said the princess. ‘I have hardly closed my eyes the whole night! Heaven knows what was in the bed. I seemed to be lying upon some hard thing, and my whole body is black and blue this morning. It is terrible!’
They saw at once that she must be a real princess when she had felt the pea through twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds. Nobody but a real princess could have such a delicate skin.
So the prince took her to be his wife, for now he was sure that he had found a real princess, and the pea was put into the Museum, where it may still be seen if no one has stolen it."
